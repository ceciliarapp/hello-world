# hello-world

I'm a University at Buffalo student studying biomedical engineering. 
I want to expand my knowledge of code and develop my programming skills.

I'm looking for internships in the biomedical engineering field. I'm looking to learn and work in this rapidly growing field including the areas of tissue engineering, nanodrug delivery, bioinstrumentation and more!
